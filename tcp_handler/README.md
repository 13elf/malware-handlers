# Description
This project is coded for handling reverse tcp connections in a penetration test. Project sructure is as follows:
  - handler.py
  - modules/
    - example_handler.py
    - other handlers...

Handler.py is the main script of our program which contains all the facilities and functions need to handle and manage an incoming tcp session. We also have modules folder where our customized handlers are located. These customized handlers can be coded in a way to perform tasks like advance shell handling, session backgrounding etc.(More information will be provided below)

# How to use it
The main tool has a couple of main features including but not limited to starting foreground and background listeners, switching between sessions, loading different handler modules and killing sessions. Each section is explained below:

## Listening for incoming sessions
The command "listen" is used for binding to a local port for incoming connectoins. The syntax is the command "listen" followed by the port to listen on. There's also "-b" switch that can be used in conjuction with listen to start the listener in the background so that more than one incoming sessions can be caught at a time. Sample Usage:
listen 4444
listen -n 4444

## Displaying and switching between active sessions
The command "sessions" is used to list out all the active sessions caught by our handler along with their session ids. These sessions are a bunch of socket handles stored in a global dictionary variable. In order to interact with one of them, type in the "interact" command followed by the session id. That allows you to drop into the specified shell session.

If you want to leave the current session you are in without shutting it down permanently, press Ctrl + C and it will only terminate the handler threads, not the socket handle itself. That way, you get back to the main program prompt without terminating that particular session. From that point on, you can switch over to any other session you want
