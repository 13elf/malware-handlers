# Description

When dealing with TCP sessions, decoding the traffic that comes from the client is an essential process that can sometimes be quite problematic. If the output of the executed command contains non-ASCII characters and we're trying to decode it, python will throw an exception when it hits a non-ASCII character. One way around this problem is to call decode function with the "ignore" argument which ignores any non-ASCII characters. But it might be some sort of data, like a password, where every byte counts. The code in this section addresses that problem.
