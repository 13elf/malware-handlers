# Description

When dealing with TCP sessions, decoding the traffic that comes from the client is an essential process that can sometimes be quite problematic. If the output of the executed command contains non-ASCII characters and we're trying to decode it, python will throw an exception when it hits a non-ASCII character. One way around this problem is to call decode function with the "ignore" argument which ignores any non-ASCII characters. But it might be some sort of data, like a password, where every byte counts. The code in this section addresses that problem.

# How it works
The function starts a listener on a port which should be given to the constructor of InitializeHandler . When a session arrives at the listener, the program prints a success message and starts interacting with the malware agent. If a data that contains non-ASCII characters, ascii characters are decoded as usual but non-ascii characters get converted into the corresponding hex string and printed out in red (ex: abc\xad\xd9yyy. Consider \xad and \xd9 in red). That allows us to both get the full data and not break the program at the same time.

Similar logic applies when sending data to the target. With normal characters, everything works as usual but when the user types a backslash and an "x" followed by two hex digits (ex: \xff), this sequence of 4 characters get encoded into one byte and sent across the wire as a single byte. This allows the us to talk to the malware agent in the target language even if we dont have required keyboard layout on our local computer.

# Use case
Suppose we need to read the contents of a file whose name contains a special character. We first run "ls" in the directory where the file is located. That will give us an output with some bytes in red meaning they cant be decoded in ascii. It will look like a sequence of normal characters (ex: abcdef) and some hex bytes appneded with backslash + "x" (ex: \xff) concatenated togetger. Then we run cat on the file by placing the file name as exactly as we have received it. The hex characters appended with "\x" will be interpreted as bytes, not string. That way we get to read the file successfully even if we dont know what these non-decoded letters look like.
